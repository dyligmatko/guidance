That's why you need ShowSim 3D 105, the latest version of the world's most advanced fireworks simulation software. ShowSim 3D 105 is designed for companies that require the highest quality simulation presentations when bidding on shows[^2^]. It allows you to construct the display site using 3D models that can be viewed from any angle[^2^]. You can also import your own 3D models or use the built-in library of common objects such as buildings, bridges, monuments, trees, and more[^2^]. You can even create custom terrain and water effects to match your location[^2^].
 
ShowSim 3D 105 also features the most realistic simulation graphics of pyrotechnic effects available on the market. It has over 2000 stock simulations of all common effects, usable in any caliber[^2^]. You can also simulate specialty effects such as confetti, streamers, girandolas, rockets, parachute effects, water shells, multi-break shells, and more[^2^]. You can also create your own custom effects using the powerful editors that let you adjust every parameter of the simulation[^2^]. You can even create custom burst patterns for shells using an intuitive graphical interface[^2^].
 
But ShowSim 3D 105 is not just about graphics. It also has a sophisticated scripting system that lets you design your show with ease and precision. You can drag and drop effects from the browser to the timeline, adjust cue times by dragging on the timeline, work with both burst times and launch times, use a variety of time formats including SMPTE 24, 25 & 30, edit multiple cues at once, generate automatic descriptions, view show cost and inventory reserves as you work, and much more[^2^]. You can also export your script to various formats such as pdf, excel, text, and common firing system formats[^2^].
 
And of course, ShowSim 3D 105 lets you simulate your show with stunning realism and accuracy. You can choose from different camera angles or use a free camera mode to fly around the scene. You can also adjust the lighting conditions, weather effects, smoke density, wind direction and speed, and ambient sounds to create different atmospheres. You can also synchronize your show with music using the built-in audio player or an external device. You can even create video files of your show to share with your clients or friends[^2^].
