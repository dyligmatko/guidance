MIDIQ works like a slot machine: you can drag and drop different symbols to define repeating chords, and the plugin will generate a chord for each position. You can also click on any chord box to explore alternative sequences for the current pattern. The plugin will automatically create eight variants for you to choose from. You can also manually edit the chords by clicking on them and changing the chord symbols.
 
MIDIQ is compatible with any DAW that supports MIDI routing. You can place it on a generator track or use multiple instances of it to create complex polyphonic progressions or polyrhythmic loops. You can also drag and drop the chords from the piano roll display to your host sequencer. MIDIQ also supports copy-and-paste, drag-to-host and export functionalities for easy data transfer.
 
With MIDIQ, you don't need any knowledge of music theory to create amazing chord progressions. You can experiment with different patterns, styles and genres, and let the plugin do the magic for you. MIDIQ is a great tool for both studio and live applications, as it can inspire you with fresh ideas and help you overcome creative blocks.

## How to Use MIDIQ in Your DAW
 
MIDIQ is compatible with any DAW that supports MIDI routing. To use it, you need to place it on a MIDI track and route its output to another track that hosts a synth or a sampler. You can also use multiple instances of MIDIQ to control different instruments or layers. For example, you can use one instance of MIDIQ to generate chords, another one to generate bass lines, and another one to generate melodies.
 
To route MIDIQ's output to another track, you need to follow these steps:
 
- Create a MIDI track and insert MIDIQ on it.
- Create another MIDI track and insert your synth or sampler on it.
- On the second track, set the input source to the first track (the one with MIDIQ).
- On the first track, enable the monitor button (the one that looks like a speaker).
- On the second track, enable the record arm button (the one that looks like a circle).

Now you can play MIDIQ on the first track and hear the sound from the second track. You can also record the MIDI output from MIDIQ by pressing the record button on your DAW.
  
## How to Create Chord Progressions with MIDIQ
 
MIDIQ makes creating chord progressions very easy and fun. You can use its pattern language to define repeating chords, and let the plugin generate variations for you. You can also edit the chords manually or drag them to your host sequencer.
 
To create chord progressions with MIDIQ, you need to follow these steps:

- On the pattern area, drag and drop different symbols to define your chord sequence. You can use symbols like I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII to represent scale degrees, or symbols like T (tonic), S (subdominant), D (dominant) to represent harmonic functions. You can also use symbols like + (augmented), - (diminished), 7 (seventh), 9 (ninth) to modify the chords.
- As you add or change symbols, MIDIQ will generate a chord for each position and display it on the chord area. You can click on any chord box to explore alternative sequences for the current pattern. MIDIQ will create eight variants for you to choose from.
- If you want to edit a chord manually, you can click on it and change the chord symbols as desired. You can use symbols like C, D#, Fm, G7 to represent chord names, or symbols like M (major), m (minor), o (diminished), + (augmented) to represent chord qualities. You can also use symbols like b (flat), # (sharp), 5 (fifth), 6 (sixth) to modify the chords.
- If you want to drag a chord to your host sequencer, you can click on it and drag it from the piano roll display. You can also drag the whole chord sequence by clicking and dragging from the top left corner of the piano roll display.

With MIDIQ, you can create amazing chord progressions in minutes. You can experiment with different patterns, styles and genres, and let the plugin do the magic for you.
